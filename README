MaybeLater is an application to help you with managing your Getting Things Done task lists. It's web-based, so you can access it anywhere you have a web browser and an internet connection, and it's open source, so you can deploy it on your own server. It supports multiple users in the same system.

Built on the Django framework for Python, it's easy to customise without re-inventing the wheel.

Please see the INSTALL file for installation details, and the COPYING file for license details.
