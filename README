-- Getting Started: --

Requirements:
* Python 2.4 or later

These instructions assume that you don't already have a Django deployment, because that's the most common case at the moment. If you're trying to slot this into an existing Django project, you probably know what you're doing anyway. 

Step one:
Installing Django. See http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/install/ for full instructions. Skip this step if you already have Django 0.97 or later installed.
'cd' to where you want to install Django. Django will be run from this location.
svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/ django-trunk
cd django-trunk
SP=`python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()"`
sudo ln -s `pwd`/django $SP/django
sudo ln -s `pwd`/django/bin/django-admin.py /usr/local/bin/django-admin.py
And that's it.

Step two:
Installing MaybeLater. 
'cd' to the directory you'd like to install MaybeLater.
svn checkout http://maybelater.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ maybelater-trunk
SP=`python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()"`
cd maybelater-trunk
sudo ln -s `pwd`/maybelater $SP/maybelater

Step three:
Importing MaybeLater to Django.
FIXME: Create project, etc.

Testing the installation:
cd into your Django project dir.
python manage.py runserver

Getting your site live:
I've only deployed MaybeLater with lighttpd and FastCGI, so that's what these instructions use.
